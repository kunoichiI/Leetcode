//Backtracking | Set 2 (Rat in a Maze)
//We have discussed Backtracking and Knightâ€™s tour problem in Set 1. 
//Let us discuss Rat in a Maze as another example problem that can be solved using Backtracking.
//
//A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is the upper left most block i.e., 
//maze[0][0] and destination block is lower rightmost block i.e., maze[N-1][N-1]. A rat starts from source and has to reach destination. 
//The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down.
//In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is dead end and 1 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination. 
//Note that this is a simple version of the typical Maze problem. For example, a more complex version can be that the rat can move in 4 directions and 
//a more complex version can be with limited number of moves.
