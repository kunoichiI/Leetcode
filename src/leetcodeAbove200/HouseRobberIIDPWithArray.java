/*
 * 213. House Robber II
 * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. 
 * Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged 
 * in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, 
 * adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police
 *  if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, 
determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

	Example 1:
	
	Input: [2,3,2]
	Output: 3
	Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
	             because they are adjacent houses.
	Example 2:
	
	Input: [1,2,3,1]
	Output: 4
	Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
	             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

/*
 * 这道题的followup在于，首尾变成了相连 adjacent，这样dp就只能分区段计算。 从0 ～ nums.length- 2
 * 和 1 ～ nums.length- 1， 规则和之前的一样。 这个仍旧是bottom up法。
